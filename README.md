# Genetic-Audio-Algorithm-Demo
This was a project completed by myself and two friends for a music module in college. It took the concept of rebuilding an audio file using a fitness function based genetic algorithm to allow the user to demonstrate audibly, how genetic algorithms work.

At certain fitness percentages (10%, 20%, 50% etc). A .wav file would be outputted by the program that could be played back by the user. Often, especially in the lower fitness percentages these files would be, if not entirely corrupt, a series of white noise. The closer it got to say 70%+, the more it began to sound like the original audio.

One of the major cons of this program was the time to complete it's task. We started running a 30 seconds file through it approximately four days before it was due and it took almost the entire time to complete. This would be something that would be a priority to address if we ever decided to revist the project.
